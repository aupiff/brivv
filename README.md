Programmatic email.

Augmenting natural language with programming languages.

Event-sourced email threads and thread-groups associated with "smart contract"
email templates.

Clients maintain template state, equivalent to contract state on Ethereum
blockchain. Clients can variably expose template state via API similar to web3.
Niether smart contract code nor state need be revealed to users; rather, only an ABI
must be encoded in an email.

What profit hath a man for all his email wherein he emaileth under the sun?
We've lost the beauty of a handwritten letter in exchange for speed -- emails
are written not to endure but to be sent and sent quickly. But there is profit
to be extracted, besides speed, from the cold medium of today.

brivv is a transhuminist project that aims to transform modern languages into
a lambda calculus-influenced argot that will make language precise where
precision is needed and allow human interactions to accumulate program state,
both ephemeral and eternal.

## Phase 1

L'email est n√© libre et partout il est dans les fers. Email must throw off the
chains of gmail, whose web UI has wrought great sorrow, and move towards the
decentralized model of yesteryear. Everyone should be in control of their email
server and emails should be private. [Lavabit](https://lavabit.com) and
[Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) don't even come close to what we need.

Whenever a user is ready to leave my platform and host their own email server, the process should take 10 minutes and they shouldn't lose their identity (email address) or email history.


## Phase 2

Email thread state, email client-compiler response type-checking. Support for
simply-typed LC.

An very simple example:

You're a lawyer who creates LLCs for clients. You have a client intake form (a template which exists at some smart contract address in your local client) that you send out to be filled out by 100 different individuals. The individuals respond to your smart-contract-in-email-form using their email programs. The clients' email programs refuse to send a message if their response doesn't match the ABI of your intake form template. Your email program would reject any emails that do not match your template ABI too, in case the client's email program is buggy. After you have received all the intake forms forms from clients, you would map over the necessary data for each client, transmit it to London's incorporation API (also a simple, private email-based smart contract), and wait for a new tax ID. Simple people will be able to set up apis for everything, effortlessly. We don't need centralized servers to make APIs or store data. Spam is much less of an issue because of cryptographic signatures and reputation systems.

Email programs can expose template state for public contracts used for scheduling meetings, for example. A lawyer has a calendar contract that exposes information about when he has time for a call; certain privileged clients could book calls automatically.

## Phase 3
