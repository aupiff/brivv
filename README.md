Programmatic email.

Augmenting natural language with programming languages.

Event-sourced email threads and thread-groups associated with "smart contract"
email templates.

Clients maintain template state, equivalent to contract state on Ethereum
blockchain. Clients can variably expose template state via API similar to web3.
Niether smart contract code nor state need be revealed to users; rather, only an ABI
must be encoded in an email.

What profit hath a man for all his email wherein he emaileth under the sun?
We've lost the beauty of a handwritten letter in exchange for speed -- emails
are written not to endure but to be sent and sent quickly. But there is profit
to be extracted, besides speed, from the cold medium of today.

brivv is a transhuminist project that aims to transform modern languages into
lambda calculus-influenced argot that will make language precise where
precision is needed and allow human interactions to accumulate program state,
both ephemeral and eternal.

## Phase 1

L'email est n√© libre et partout il est dans les fers. Email must throw off the
chains of gmail, whose web UI has wrought great sorrow, and move towards the
decentralized model of yesteryear. Everyone should be in control of their email
server and emails should be private. [Lavabit](https://lavabit.com) and
[Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) don't even come close to what we need.

## Phase 2

Email thread state, email client-compiler response type-checking. Support for
simply-typed LC.

## Phase 3

Calculus of Inductive Constructions
