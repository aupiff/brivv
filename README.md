Programmatic email.

Augmenting natural language with programming languages.

Event-sourced email threads and thread-groups associated with "smart contract"
email templates.

Clients maintain template state, equivalent to contract state on Ethereum
blockchain. Clients can variably expose template state via API similar to web3.
Smart contract code nor state need not be revealed to users; rather, only an ABI
need be encoded in an email.
